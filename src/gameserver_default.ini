# MultiOgar configurations file
# Lines starting with number sign (#) are comments

# [NOTE]
# MultiOgar uses cell size instead of cell mass to improve performance!
# In order to get the cell size from mass value, you need to calculate using this formula:
#     size = SQRT( mass * 100 )
#
# For example, to set start mass = 43:
#     size = SQRT( 43 * 100 ) = SQRT( 4300 ) = 65.57
# Set playerStartSize = 66
#
# Also, you can use the following syntax to specify mass:
#     playerStartSize = massToSize(43)
# It will be automatically converted to 66

# [Log]

# logFileVerbosity: File log level

# [Server]
# serverTimeout: Seconds to keep connection alive for non-responding client
# serverWsModule: WebSocket module: 'ws' or 'uws' (install npm package before using uws)
# serverIpLimit: Controls the maximum connections from single IP (use 0 to disable)
# serverMinionIgnoreTime: minion detection disable time on server startup [seconds]
# serverMinionThreshold: max connections within serverMinionInterval time period, which will not be marked as minion
# serverMinionInterval: minion detection interval [milliseconds]
# serverPort: Server port which will be used to listen for incoming connections
# serverBind: Server network interface which will be used to listen for incoming connections (0.0.0.0 for all IPv4 interfaces)
# serverTracker: Set to 1 if you want to show your server on the tracker http://ogar.mivabe.nl/master (check that your server port is opened for external connections before setting it to 1)
# serverGamemode: 0 = FFA, 1 = Teams, 2 = Experimental, 3 = InstantMerge, 4 = Crazy, 5 = SelfFeed
# serverBots: Number of player bots to spawn (Experimental)
# serverViewBase: Base view distance of players. Warning: high values may cause lag! Min value is 1920x1080
# serverMinScale: Min scale for player (low value leads to lags due to large visible area for big cell)
# serverSpectatorScale: Scale (field of view) used for free roam spectators (low value leads to lags, vanilla=0.4, old vanilla=0.25)
# serverStatsPort: Port for the stats server. Having a negative number will disable the stats server.
# serverStatsUpdate: Update interval of server stats in seconds
# serverScrambleLevel: Toggles scrambling of coordinates. 0 = No scrambling, 1 = lightweight scrambling. 2 = full scrambling (also known as scramble minimap), 3 - high level scrambling (no border)
# serverMaxLB: Controls the maximum players displayed on the leaderboard.
# serverChat: Allows the usage of server chat. 0 = no chat, 1 = use chat.
# serverName: Server name, for example "My great server"
# serverWelcome1: First server welcome message
# serverWelcome2: Second server welcome message (optional, for info, etc)
